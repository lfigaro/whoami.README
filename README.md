# Motivations behind this document
<tl;dr>**Time Saving**</tl;dr>

We all want to change the world but time is finited - specially at a startup. So why to spend time asking yourself if you should whether or not answer me a FYI email if we can save time and go straight to the big questions?

That's why I have been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a user's manual, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

# Hi, I'm Figaro 
I'm from São Paulo. Father of a [lovely princess](img/alice.PNG) (this picture should be outdated by now, you know how they grow fast, right?) and a [indefatigable purebred mutt](img/maia.PNG) (yeah, I'm a dog person). I'm a lucky guy because I married a flight attendant which gives me the opportunity not just to be with an amazing woman as to [travel A LOT](https://www.mytravelmap.xyz/u/gg112445688203607613260), something I really enjoy doing.

I'm an (VERY) extroverted person. Sometimes I start a small talk just because. It helps me recharge my batteries. I'll promise try not to do it if I note it bothers you. But do know that I really like to hear all kinds of stories and I'm always open to a good talk.

Some of my quirks while working:
- I'm always in a good mood.
-
