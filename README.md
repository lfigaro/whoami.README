This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division or team. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be completely aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you find throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me and it applies to me only.

# Motivations behind this document
*<tl;dr>**Time Saving**</tl;dr>*

We all want to change the world but time is finited - specially at a startup. So why to spend time asking yourself if you should whether or not answer me a FYI email if we can save time and go straight to the big questions?

Focusing to improve that and having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a leadership's user manual, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

# Hi, I'm Figaro 

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Father of a [lovely princess](img/alice.png) (this picture should be outdated by now, you know how they grow fast, right?) and a [indefatigable purebred mutt](img/maia.png) (yeah, I'm a dog person). I'm a lucky guy because I married a flight attendant which gives me the opportunity not just to be with an amazing woman as to [travel A LOT](https://www.mytravelmap.xyz/u/gg112445688203607613260), something I really enjoy doing.

I'm an (VERY) extroverted person. Sometimes I start a small talk just because. It helps me recharge my batteries. I'll promise try not to do it if I note it bothers you. But do know that I really like to hear all kinds of stories and I'm always open to a good talk.

Some of my quirks while working:
- I'm always in a good mood. Please do not confuse it with being complacent.
- I have high expectations on people as well as on myself.
- A common question you will hear from me is "What problem are we solving by doing that?".
- I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics or who want to commit to plans and then not change them.
- Although I'm a process oriented guy, I hate unnecessary bureaucracy. The simpler, the better.
- I really want people to be autonomous. If you know you are able to make a decision without consulting me, make it!
- Although I'm brazilian, there's one quirk in our culture that I don't relate to: Punctuality. I'm always on time and I tend not to wait much for delayed people.

If you’re curious about my professional experience please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lfigaro). And if you're curious about how I code, try out my [Github](http://github.com/lfigaro/whoami.README), just don't be judgy since I'm REALLY an outdated developer :-)

# My mission

I want to help people related to me be their best version and be my own in the way :-)


# How I work

## Communication

I work very well with async communication but for more urgent matters, I prefer face to face. The perfect hierarchy of communication for me should be (most → least urgent): Face 2 face → Call → Whatsapp → Slack → Email. 

I don't need acknowledgement on written communications as I'll not provide that. I'll trust you're up to something when I send an email / whatsapp / slack (let's face it, there's no need to confirm email receive nowadays)

Although I'm a talker I tend to be straight and concise when asking for something. My experience shows me that I'm more clear by doing that.
