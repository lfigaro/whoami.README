# Figaro's READMEs

# Disclaimer
This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be completely aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you find throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me and it applies to me only.

# Motivations behind this document
Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager’s README, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

# Hi, I'm Figaro 
I was born in São Paulo, Brazil, where I live until today. Father of a [lovely princess](img/alice.PNG) (this picture should be outdated by now, you know how they grow fast, right?) and a [indefatigable purebred mutt](img/maia.PNG). I'm a lucky guy because I married a flight attendant which gives me the opportunity not just to be with a amazing woman as to [travel A LOT](https://www.mytravelmap.xyz/u/gg112445688203607613260), something I really enjoy doing.
